# DiabetesML-Supervised-Classfication-
This is a repo containing several files:
 * A jupyter notebook file going through the EDA of the diabetes data set obtained from kaggle. This problem set required a Supervised Classification ML model to classify weather patient records were non-diabetic (0) or diabetic (1).
 * Several models were used and the model with the highest accuracy score underwent hyperparameter tuning utlizing Optuna library.
 * Cleaned CSV was exported for reference.
 * Joblib dumps of both the scaler and prediction model utilized.
 * The ML model built in the notebook was exported and hosted onto Streamlit at the following link:
